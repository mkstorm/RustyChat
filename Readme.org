* About
RustyChat is an Irc client written in rust.
It is the first project i have written in rust, and it is supposed to be a learning experience.
The client is using Ratatui as the tui frontend.

It also implements async server connections using tokio.

It connects as default to port 6667, i havent tested on other ports, and likely wouldnt work on any other.

I have implemented the most common Irc commands and server responses, far from all of the commands are represented.

It is possible to connect to twitch chat through the client, it requires Twitch nickname and oauth set in the config.

This is the first pass of the application, The code need to be cleaned up and needs comments, as right now some of it is
a bit messy.

Below the application is explained, otherwise there is an in app help list.

* Features

** Async connection
It handles multiple connections to different Irc servers.
When a new server is join a "Status" channel is added to the channel overview.
Then as long as Status or a different channel on that server is the active element, all commands
are sent to the respective server.
The Status gets all the join/part/quit and commands that are not chat messages.
If a command doesnt work, check the Status, thats where the error message is stored.

** Split view
There is a /split function to split your view vertically to have 2 chats open at the same time.
It doesnt have to be on the same server.
There is only one prompt so when in split view use tab to change the active "window".

** Channel/server list
There is a channel/server list to see what is connect to or joined.
It is indicated with a ">".
[[/Images/channels.png]]

** In prompt styling
When you are writing a message in the prompt you kan style the message with: Bold/Italic/underline and color,
and it shows directly in the prompt and of course in the chat window when sent.
Input mode is indicated top right of prompt

** Private message buffer
If you recieve a private message you will see the message in your current active channel, as well as a new channel with the nickname of the sender
in the channel overview. Sending messages in the buffer is as all other channels.
It is also possible to send /msg nick message to start a private conversation yourself.

** Theming using Rgb
The config file has theme options for text, foreground, background and more.

** Autoconnect
It is also possible in the config to set servers and channels to autoconnect on application launch.

** Twitch Chat connection
If Twitch nick and oauth token is present in the config, you can connect to the twitch chat servers and join channels to chat.

** Individual server Nicks
Each server Stores a Nick name. If you have login with a specific nick you can add the nick to autoconnect or change it in system Status before connecting to a server.

** User list
The application also tracks each channels users. So far it is only showing modes of users if they are present in the server response when joining a channel.

** Visual Notifications
The channel list displays a notification "!" when something have happened and it is not the current active channel.
It doesnt show notifications for "Status", as it is usually generic server responses.

** List command
If you use the List command (Or Alis in libera chat), a popup with show with the list response, and it can be scrolled using PGup and PGdown.

** Menu

Use Up and Down to scroll prompt history.
